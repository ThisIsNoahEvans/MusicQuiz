# MusicQuiz
Computer Science Project

# What is this?
This is a project I completed for Computer Science at school. It is a game where you have to guess the name of a song from the first letter of each word.

# Why is it here?
It's public on GitHub because why not - it's a pretty cool thing I made, and if it helps someone in the future, then that's great. I won't be maintaining or continuing development of this, as my project has been submitted.

# Usage
If you do happen to want to play this random game yourself, then clone/download the repo and run `main.py`. Have fun, I guess. The songs included in `songs.json` are from my [Apple Music Replay 2021](https://replay.music.apple.com) (basically the songs I have listened to most in 2021), as it was an easy dataset to find.
